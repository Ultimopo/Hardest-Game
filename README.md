# Hardest-Game

Hardest game feels more like the "shittiest game" 
Anyways you have decided on playing my stupid game.

## Installation

You'll need unity hub, that's pretty much it though is opitional if youre going for the WebGL version which is linked at the bottom.
Go to Assets/Scenes and click on starterlevel or whatever the fuck its called.

## Controls

If you're stupid enough not to know the movement keys, I'm surprised.
WASD to move, yeah thats it. No funky shitty ass game mechanics or anything really.

## Features

If you're not drunk enough to play on this game, you're free to try the "Drunk level" which is unlocked after you beat the hard level.
